Frequently Asked Questions

Do I have to mail the letters myself?

Yes. This is a DIY tool. You generate the letters here, then print and mail them via USPS Certified Mail. This is exactly what credit repair companies do - we just give you the letters so you can do it yourself and save $1,000+.

Why can't I just dispute online?

You can, but mailed letters are more effective. They create a legal paper trail, are harder for bureaus to auto-reject, and carry more weight under the FCRA. Professionals always use mail.

Is this legal?

Absolutely. The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) gives you the legal right to dispute any information on your credit report. These letters help you exercise that right properly.

How is this different from credit repair companies?

Credit repair companies use the exact same letters - they just charge you $100+/month to mail them. We give you the letters so you can mail them yourself and keep the savings.

How long does it take to see results?

Credit bureaus must respond within 30-45 days of receiving your letter. Results depend on your situation and how consistently you mail letters and follow up.

How much does mailing cost?

About $5-7 per letter for USPS Certified Mail with Return Receipt. Compare that to $100+/month for credit repair services!
